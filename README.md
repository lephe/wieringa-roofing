> R. M. A. Wieringa noticed that the
> thick and thin rhombs are in fact
> projections of a single rhomb in 3d.
> Take a rhomb whose short diagonal
> equals the short diagonal of the thick
> rhomb and whose long diagonal is the
> long diagonal of the thin rhomb.
> Using the x and y coordinates of the
> tiling and half of the index as the
> z-coordinate gives a faceted surface of
> thickness 3 called a Wieringa roof.
> Note that the endpoints of the short
> diagonal of the thick rhomb and the
> endpoints of the long diagonal of the
> thin rhomb always have the same index
